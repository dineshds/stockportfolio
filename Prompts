I want to develop a stock portfolio tracker.

Details are in the README.md file.

Suggest a tech stack for this project.
Yes, Streamlit would be an excellent choice for this project! Here's a simplified tech stack using Streamlit:

Frontend & Backend (Combined):
- Streamlit - For the entire web interface and backend logic
  - Handles both UI and data processing
  - Built-in support for data visualization
  - Easy deployment
  - Perfect for data-heavy applications

Data Visualization:
- Plotly - For interactive financial charts
- Streamlit's native plotting capabilities

Database:
- SQLite - For local development
- PostgreSQL - For production deployment

APIs:
- yfinance (Yahoo Finance) - For stock data
- Alpha Vantage (as backup) - For additional market data

Deployment:
- Streamlit Cloud - For easy hosting
- Docker (optional) - If you need custom deployment

Additional Libraries:
- pandas - For data manipulation
- numpy - For numerical computations

This stack is much simpler than a traditional web stack and perfect for:
- Rapid development
- Data-focused applications
- Quick prototyping
- Single developer projects
- Easy maintenance

The main advantage of using Streamlit is that you can build the entire application in Python without needing to know JavaScript or web development frameworks.
